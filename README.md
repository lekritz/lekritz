# Hi there 👋, my name is Henryk.
### I'm a young basic software developer.

I'm a intermediate programmer that specialises in _Python_ development. I’m currently learning _C++_ and I've completely learned the art of _Python_. I know I have to learn about web development by teaching myself _P.H.P._, _Redwood_, _JavaScript_ or _Ruby_, but I don't find it fun. My favourite programming language is _Python_. It was the first programming language I learned (that wasn't brick-programming) and nowadays I could build quite much anything using it.
