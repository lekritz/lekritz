# Let me introduce myself
- 👋 Hi, My name is Henryk! I'm a intermediate programmer that specialises in _Python_ development.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and learning about how computers store and execute raw data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning _C++_ and I've completely learned the art of _Python_. I know I have to learn about web development by teaching myself _P.H.P._, _Redwood_, _JavaScript_ or _Ruby_, but I don't find it fun.
- 💞️ I'm not currently looking to collaborate on big projects, that will require commitment long-term.
- 📫 You can reach me by messaging me on the social media links that I have. Not really ready to create a e-mail account dedicated for collaboration.
- 🍟 My favourite programming language is *Python*. It was the first programming language I learned (that wasn't brick-programming) and nowadays I could build quite much anything using it.
