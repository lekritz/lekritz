- 👋 Hi, I’m @lekritz
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and how computers store and execute binary data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, and I've completely learned the art of Python.
- 💞️ I'm not currently looking to collaborate on big projects, that will require commitment long-term.
- 📫 You can reach me by messaging me on the social media links that I have. Not really ready to create a e-mail account dedicated for collaboration.
